Progress:
     (Major Feature) For the milestone, our app consists of a tab bar that allows the user to navigate to classes, assignments, and settings
     pages. The user can also navigate to "add" pages that will eventually save data to table views to show current classes and assignments. 
     (Optional Feature 1: Consume Web Service)So far, the user can go to the Add Class view and search for potential courses. Currently, the search result will 
     output the parsed JSON for a class that is fetched from Lou's list using our api (data is already scraped and hosted on AWS). (Optional Feature 2: Core Data)
     The user can navigate to the assignments tab and create assignments that are saved using Core Data. Once the user adds an
     assignment, the console will output the data showing what has been saved in Core Data.
